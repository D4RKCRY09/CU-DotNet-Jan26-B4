**The Challenge: "The SaaS
Architect"**

**1. The Foundation (Abstraction
& Inheritance)**

Create an abstract class
Subscriber with:

* **Properties:** Guid ID, string Name, and
  DateTime JoinDate.
* **Abstract Method:** decimal
  CalculateMonthlyBill().
* **Inheritance:** Create two subclasses:
  * BusinessSubscriber: Has a FixedRate and a TaxRate.
  * ConsumerSubscriber: Has a DataUsageGB and
    PricePerGB.

**2. Identity & Comparison
(Equals & Comparable)**

To manage your list effectively,
you must define how Subscriber objects are identified and ordered:

* **Override Equals and GetHashCode** : Two
  subscribers are equal if they have the same ID.
* **Implement IComparable`<Subscriber>`** : The
  default sort order should be by JoinDate (ascending). If dates are
  identical, sort alphabetically by Name.

**3. The Data Structure
(Dictionary & Sorting)**

In your main program, initialize a
Dictionary<string, Subscriber> where the key is the subscriber's **Email**
and the value is the Subscriber object.

**The Task:**

1. Add at least 5 mixed subscribers to the Dictionary.
2. **The Hard Part:** Sort the **Dictionary** by
   the Subscriber's monthly bill (descending) and store the result in a way
   that preserves order for the report.

**Note:** Remember that a
standard Dictionary is unordered. You will need to use LINQ or a
SortedDictionary with a custom comparer to achieve this.

**4. Polymorphic Reporting**

Create a ReportGenerator class
with a static method PrintRevenueReport(IEnumerable`<Subscriber>`
subscribers).

* It should iterate through the collection and call
  CalculateMonthlyBill() polymorphically.
* **Bonus:** Use a StringBuilder to format a
  table-style output that includes the specific type of subscriber (Business
  vs. Consumer).

| **Equality**                                          | myDict.ContainsKey(newID) works |

| List<KeyValuePair<string, Subscriber>> or LINQ to order the |                                 |

| **Reporting**                                         | Output must be sorted by the    |
| calculated bill amount.                                     |                                 |

**Suggested Math for Billing**

To keep it interesting, use these
formulas in your overrides:

* **Business:**

{Total} = {FixedRate} \times (1 +
\text{TaxRate})

* **Consumer:**

{Total} = {DataUsageGB} \times
\text{PricePerGB}
