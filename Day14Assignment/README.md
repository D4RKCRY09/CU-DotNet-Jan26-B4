Employee Management Component
📌 Overview
This project features a robust Employee class implementation in C#. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically focusing on various ways to handle data encapsulation and validation within the .NET ecosystem.

🚀 Key Features
Encapsulation: Utilizes private fields with explicit getter/setter methods for ID management.

Data Validation: Implements logic-driven "Full Properties" to restrict Department types (Accounts, Sales, IT) and enforce Salary ranges (50,000 - 90,000).

Auto-Properties: Simplifies boilerplate code for standard data fields like Name.
